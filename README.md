# Machine-Learning-Stock-Predictor
This is a python machine learning program that is trained using previous S&P 500 data to predict future S&P 500 trends and prices. 
A random forest classifier was the algorithm used for this machine learning project. Further math was used to make the predictor 
more accurate such as rolling averages over several different time intervals.
